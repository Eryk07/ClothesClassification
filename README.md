# ClothesClassification

Machine Learning project made with data from [Zalando Fashion MNIST dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist). The goal is to classify clothes (10 types).

Made with Jupyter Notebook and Python.

In the folder `models/` there are only files under 15MB. So if there's no some model from notebook, it means that it was to big to attach on github. To see ignored files, you can also look into `.gitignore` file.
